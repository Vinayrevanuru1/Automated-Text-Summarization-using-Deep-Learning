       " 'Review: cnn vice president joe biden delivered rousing address to the naacp in houston on thursday bolstering support for president barack obama and drawing sharp contrasts with the republican party on civil rights issues on the heels of recent voter identification disputes biden strayed from his typical campaign speech to zero in on voting rights arguing that republicans were making it more difficult for certain group to vote by implementing laws requiring voters to present official identification at the voting booth biden said the gop sees different future where voting is made harder not easier democrats have said that such laws are politically motivated and intended to suppress minority voting given that fewer people in minority groups carry government issued ids republicans meanwhile make the case that such laws prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the system the issue was hot topic this week at the naacp convention where attorney general eric holder spoke tuesday and lambasted states that have considered or attempted to implement such laws including texas wisconsin and pennsylvania appealing to the group founding biden on thursday urged the crowd to remember what the naacp at its core was all about it was about the right to vote because when you have the right to vote you have the right to change things he said he called on the crowd to imagine what the justice department would look like under mitt romney administration imagine the recommendations and who he likely to pick for attorney general or head of the civil rights division he said drawing scorn from the audience the vice president also touched on number of other issues including energy health care women issues and education in each instance he compared obama policies with those of the republican party he particularly faulted the gop for obstructing what he considers key legislation since obama took office their discipline is amazing they have never let up biden said referring to congressional republicans but neither has my guy neither has president barack obama he has not given up he continues to be driven by the character of his convictions this was biden first time addressing the convention as vice president the naacp said the vice president is longtime friend to the naacp said roslyn brock the group chairwoman he has been strong advocate for justice and equality over his decades of service in the senate and the white house the president will miss the event because of scheduling conflict his campaign said we declined few weeks ago and the naacp was pleased vice president joe biden was able to attend an obama biden campaign official told cnn the president schedule for thursday initially appeared wide open but senior administration official confirmed thursday morning that obama and the first lady will give an interview to cbs during the day however the president did make brief appearance in pre taped video that ran before the vice president appeared if you keep standing with me know we can arrive there together the president said after delivering few lines from his typical stump speech on helping middle class americans hilary shelton the naacp washington bureau director and senior vice president in the organization said the white house never confirmed visit they were trying to work out something shelton said as to why obama could not attend he added it was that something could not be moved something was crucial and unfortunately they couldn move it in way they could get him here this week obama addressed the convention in 2009 last year first lady michelle obama spoke to the group biden speech thursday came one day after romney was booed during his own remarks at the naacp convention when the republican vowed to repeal the affordable care act obama signature health care law in comparison biden drew thunderous applause after trumpeting health care reform and emphasized that the law ensures coverage to million black americans who never would have had insurance the one time the crowd gave negative reaction occurred when biden began to close his remarks he received standing ovation from about half the audience at the end meanwhile romney said the negative reaction he experienced wednesday didn come as surprise think we expected that he said on fox business network am going to give the same message to the naacp that give across the country which is that obamacare is killing jobs two african american members of the house of representatives found themselves split after romney appearance he gets credit for attendance rep cedric richmond louisiana democrat said on cnn the situation room but perfect attendance doesn qualify you to be class president thought it was good gesture to go but thought his content was lacking rep tim scott republican from south carolina also said on the situation room that he expects romney to get about 10 of the black vote come november suggesting the gop candidate focus should be on unemployment and home foreclosures african american unemployment since 2008 is up 40 scott said home closures 25 so what we have is the same message that works for the rest of america works for the black community too romney draws boos from naacp support from conservatives cnn dan lothian shawna shepherd shannon travis and ed payne and contributed to this report \\n',\n",

baseball hats not convinced said mario lopez after taking look with his wife julia and their three children believe the roger patterson footage is authentic because you can see the muscles and everything on there but this one was kind of different but he did mention that after the autopsy the body kind of changes he said to the houston chronicle roger patterson is the man who filmed one of the most famous sightings back in 1967 patterson died in 1972 and the man who wore the gorilla suit in the film even admitted it was hoax wendy hernandez was so convinced that she bought shirt and had dyer sign it it amazing when you go inside you feel different she said had never seen anything like this before only on the discovery channel body of the beast rick dyer claims that this is photo of legendary creature bigfoot which he shot near san antonio 18 months ago mr dyer claims that he lured the 800 pound beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from walmart to tree in san antonio texas in september 2012 he initially released grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature face but has now released second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill 36 year old dyer said he didn regret his 2008 hoax as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full time bigfoot operations ever since he claims that without the previous publicity stunt he would never have been able to really capture bigfoot have 13 months with it dyer said last month then it will probably go into museum as the first bigfoot ever killed on the bigfoot trail rick dyer says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at walmart to tree while the creature was eating mr dyer allegedly shot it speaking of the moment he killed the beast he said nailed pork ribs from the walmart down the street to the side of the tree and lo and behold he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree mr dyer claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal before going to get his gun and with tears in my eyes shot it dead the excitement surrounding mr dyer claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in bigfoot hoax back in 2008 back then as now he claimed he had the body of bigfoot but the national geographic reported that once the frozen body began to thaw the body turned out to be nothing more than rubber ape suit this time mr dyer is adamant that his bigfoot is for real he said from dna tests to 3d optical scans to body scans it is the real deal it bigfoot and bigfoot here and shot it and now proving it to the world video by rick dyer committed hunter mr dyer is self proclaimed real bigfoot tracker although he is used car salesman in his spare time there was hoax in 2008 he said it didn’t start out as hoax and that’s what people don’t understand this is about redeeming myself don’t want to go down as hoaxer want to go down as the best bigfoot tracker in the world however mr dyer has yet to produce the results of the dna tests and optical scans bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world but physical evidence such as partial or complete body of the creature has so far proven elusive his tour has so far been traveling across texas and will visit louisiana georgia and florida over the coming months admission costs 20 fuzzy face what appears to be large humanoid creature scowls at the camera in this grainy still from video footage mr dyer claims it is none other than bigfoot

real women who aren’t afraid to flaunt their flabby bits who can but applaud we are encouraged to believe the recent spate of advertisements from the likes of and dove cosmetics in which stick thin taut and toned models have been rejected in favour of what are euphemistically known as ‘big’ girls marks spencer use models to promote the retailer sexy shapewear range dr ellie cannon said some could be overweight while one was obese taking the test from left julia angela sarah melissa tracey and monica gave their verdicts on the underwear after the advert stirred up controversy the message is loud and clear forget twiggy and myleene klass the former faces of all things fashionable and instead embrace the woman you truly are complete with your voluptuous curves and pudgy love handles at face value it all sounds very encouraging very to coin current buzz word but hold on minute aren’t we rather ignoring the elephant in the room here pardon the pun fat truth be told is neither feminist nor cosmetic issue it is quite simply health issue and we shouldn’t allow ourselves to be steered into losing sight of that fact it may appear laudable in our current politically correct climate to claim that criticising the larger lady is just as despicable as taunting the disabled or discriminating against someone because of their age or origin but frankly it’s utterly wrong the fact is it is absolutely outrageous that in an effort to illustrate the diversity of women obesity has taken its place alongside ageing and differing skin colours yes these adverts have captured the notion of individuality beautifully by using women in their 50s but including overweight and therefore unhealthy women in the mix is downright misguided at best too good to be true the mail asked real women julia angela and melissa to put slimming clothes to the test overweight the models said to represent ordinary women could be overweight according to the dr for example in the advert for its shapewear control underwear which uses women from sizes eight to 16 would say that lovely as they all look at least two if not three are overweight while the biggest girl is obese yet when women took to twitter to voice their response to the adverts the majority complained the models were ‘too perfect with too few wobbly bits ’ all too often celebrities such as the model sophie dahl or nigella lawson are touted as real women with real bodies but both have trimmed their figures in sophie’s case by several stone and say they are much happier having shed the flab statistics show that the prevalence of obesity in the uk has tripled in the past 25 years but the fact it is now so common does not make it satisfactory or healthy it may seem unfair to criticise what is essentially very common problem but day to day as gp deal with the medical consequences of patients who are overweight obesity makes woman four times as likely to suffer with high blood pressure and three times as likely to suffer heart attack according to the department of health obesity costs the nhs staggering £5 1billion year am really concerned by this trend of supposedly empowering women by what has become known as the ‘body acceptance movement’ which embraces the notion that fat is fine while fat may be fine cosmetically it is not fine for your health body shape has been hijacked solely as fashion issue and as ammunition in the war of cool versus uncool thus it is perceived as cruel and ‘size to attack those who are fat strongly condemn bullying whether it be for personal appearance or any other reason but what worries me is that the real health risks of obesity are being glossed over in an effort not to offend anyone yet at the same time we are running around in circles trying to find the obesity solution in the food and fitness industries as well as the pharmaceutical and medical fields while we readily criticise and ban smoking junk food is still an acceptable vice and overeating is rapidly becoming the biggest eating disorder in the country indeed compulsive overeating has recently been recognised in medical literature as disorder in its own right there is an understandable backlash against the anorexic models the fashion industry has promoted for the past three decades the continuing use of ill looking skeletal models is shameful and rightly condemned we know from studies of anorexics that when they idolise and obsess over images of these very thin women it exacerbates their illness and perpetuates their self loathing and body dysmorphia isn’t it just as irresponsible to promote the notion that being overweight is perfectly normal the all party parliamentary group on body image was established in 2011 to challenge the growing trend in negative body image and they work with those such as the advertising industry to address this issue they have for example stopped the use of size zero models while this is admirable we need to ensure that by trying to sort out one problem we don’t exacerbate another given that third of british women are overweight it will do our teenage daughters no favours to normalise obesity companies such as have firm place in the hearts of the public and in that respect they often mould opinions and shape our aspirations it is shame they wasted great opportunity to promote what is healthy \\n',\n",

because he could make it at all mark had spent the last international break at the hospital bedside in tenerife where terry england’s swashbuckling left back in the 1970 world cup was in intensive care following life or death bowel cancer operation it was personal trauma he had done his best to keep to himself while handling the problems of helping the football league’s youngest team to recover from 5 0 fa cup hammering at cheltenham mark cooper saw his swindon side beat bristol city to end their unbeaten run in league one michael smith scored the only goal of the game in the 78th minute at the county ground cooper had been in tenerife with his father but on saturday night the 45 year old could enjoy calling to share the details of successful day and how his side with an average age of 21 and three quarters had moved into league one’s automatic promotion places they had some help when city captain wade elliott got sent off after barely three minutes but then passed the ball relentlessly to exploit their extra man before striker michael smith right finally picked his way through packed defence to get the winner 12 minutes from time ‘i couldn’t wait to speak to dad admitted mark ‘he’s back home and just about on level now where he can focus and talk he was in intensive care for 10 days and has had that many drugs ‘it was fortunate that when he was at his most critical it was the international break we had three players called up then so we had the weekend off and managed to get out there for four days ‘the doctors said it was touch and go had to get there he was in intensive care the whole time it wasn’t nice ‘thankfully they say the operations have been successful and he’s clear now and will keep recovering he loves bristol city and has such fond memories of his time there as do because that’s where started as player but for once he’s probably happy they’ve been beaten ’ when the fixtures came out this was the first his father had booked flights for from his canary island home where he was based as southampton’s chief european scout mark’s own playing career was far less stellar than his old man who was stalwart in don revie’s all conquering leeds united teams of the 1960s but after scrapping through non league jobs at tamworth kettering darlington and telford he’s fallen on his feet cooper dad terry was in intensive care after make or break bowel cancer operation swindon is club where chairman lee power himself an ex player is building strategy based on youth and belief in passing football the budget is measly £1 5million year fraction of that spent by league one leaders city but the faith in youth is both developing their own kids and making the club favoured destination for premier league sides to send their young talent on loan last season some of tottenham’s best youngsters including ryan mason progressed at the county ground this time southampton’s impressive england defender jack stephens just 20 looked the pick of the potential terry cooper right in action for england against brazil jairzinho during the 1970 world cup in mexico ‘the chairman has been brilliant he’s an ex player so he understands cooper said ‘he put this club on sound financial footing and insisted that we try and play real good football he wants to do that so we can bring young players through ’ cooper knows it will take miracle to keep his young side in the promotion hunt it’s long season and trip to peterborough next week will be more immediate challenge but on saturday night he could enjoy small success and more important so could his dad performance of the weekend bradford have taken time to adjust to league one since promotion through the play offs in 2013 but clicked to end preston’s unbeaten run at deepdale which went back to december they dominated after leading through rory first half header and even when joe garner scrambled an equaliser five minutes from time it took just 60 seconds for mark yeates to curl in 20 yard winner bradford ended preston unbeaten run at deepdale which had stretched back to december with 2 1 win what caught my eye more like what my eye couldn’t see more than 117 000 people watched

trained in new orleans where they dealt with the aftermath of hurricane katrina and are preparing their large stock of pumps water in the two vehicle tunnels receded slightly as the tide fell tuesday morning but the massive pumps that will eventually empty the tubes were unable to immediately make headway because the places where they normally send water the river and sewer system remained so high the outflow pipes in the pumping system were still submerged our pumps are working it just that the water has no place to go mta spokeswoman judy glave said we pump it out and it just comes back in once the water is removed engineers must then examine the equipment to see how much corrosion damage was wrought by the salt water that soaked the switches signals electrical wires and stations each has to be out of the water before it is touched and and any damage will have to be fixed before the system can be restored pump flood waters each tunnel is expected to take at leave five days to pump dry keeping stations closed until saturday or sunday in the tunnels under the east river all the signal and control systems are underwater and it is salt water dr jacob told the wall street journal it not just that it doesn work right now it all has to be cleaned dried reassembled and tested and we are not sure what the long term corrosion effect might be think we have come to the end of studies what we need now is action governor andrew cuomo agreed adding we have to start thinking about how we redesign the system so this doesn happen again don think anyone can sit back anymore and say shocked at this weather pattern there is no weather pattern that can shock me anymore school was canceled for third straight day wednesday in the city where many students rely on buses and subways to reach classrooms mayor bloomberg has said that sunday’s marathon will still take place but even if runners are able to fly in it will be difficult to get everyone to the starting line without subway dr jacob’s 21 day estimate covers the time it is predicted to take city workers to bring the subway system back to 90 per cent function \\n',\n",
       " 'Original summary: start the report examined the effects on the city transportation infrastructure after 100 year storm the subway will be closed until at least saturday or sunday it is only the second time in the subway 108 year history that it has closed the u s army corps has drafted in team who worked on the clear up after hurricane katrina in new orleans workers are pumping water out on tunnels so they can examine damage electrics will have to be fixed before service can resume ten tunnels are flooded with south ferry station completely full of water end \\n',\n",
