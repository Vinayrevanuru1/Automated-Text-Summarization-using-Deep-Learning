            "Review: cnn vice president joe biden delivered rousing address to the naacp in houston on thursday bolstering support for president barack obama and drawing sharp contrasts with the republican party on civil rights issues on the heels of recent voter identification disputes biden strayed from his typical campaign speech to zero in on voting rights arguing that republicans were making it more difficult for certain group to vote by implementing laws requiring voters to present official identification at the voting booth biden said the gop sees different future where voting is made harder not easier democrats have said that such laws are politically motivated and intended to suppress minority voting given that fewer people in minority groups carry government issued ids republicans meanwhile make the case that such laws prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the system the issue was hot topic this week at the naacp convention where attorney general eric holder spoke tuesday and lambasted states that have considered or attempted to implement such laws including texas wisconsin and pennsylvania appealing to the group founding biden on thursday urged the crowd to remember what the naacp at its core was all about it was about the right to vote because when you have the right to vote you have the right to change things he said he called on the crowd to imagine what the justice department would look like under mitt romney administration imagine the recommendations and who he likely to pick for attorney general or head of the civil rights division he said drawing scorn from the audience the vice president also touched on number of other issues including energy health care women issues and education in each instance he compared obama policies with those of the republican party he particularly faulted the gop for obstructing what he considers key legislation since obama took office their discipline is amazing they have never let up biden said referring to congressional republicans but neither has my guy neither has president barack obama he has not given up he continues to be driven by the character of his convictions this was biden first time addressing the convention as vice president the naacp said the vice president is longtime friend to the naacp said roslyn brock the group chairwoman he has been strong advocate for justice and equality over his decades of service in the senate and the white house the president will miss the event because of scheduling conflict his campaign said we declined few weeks ago and the naacp was pleased vice president joe biden was able to attend an obama biden campaign official told cnn the president schedule for thursday initially appeared wide open but senior administration official confirmed thursday morning that obama and the first lady will give an interview to cbs during the day however the president did make brief appearance in pre taped video that ran before the vice president appeared if you keep standing with me know we can arrive there together the president said after delivering few lines from his typical stump speech on helping middle class americans hilary shelton the naacp washington bureau director and senior vice president in the organization said the white house never confirmed visit they were trying to work out something shelton said as to why obama could not attend he added it was that something could not be moved something was crucial and unfortunately they couldn move it in way they could get him here this week obama addressed the convention in 2009 last year first lady michelle obama spoke to the group biden speech thursday came one day after romney was booed during his own remarks at the naacp convention when the republican vowed to repeal the affordable care act obama signature health care law in comparison biden drew thunderous applause after trumpeting health care reform and emphasized that the law ensures coverage to million black americans who never would have had insurance the one time the crowd gave negative reaction occurred when biden began to close his remarks he received standing ovation from about half the audience at the end meanwhile romney said the negative reaction he experienced wednesday didn come as surprise think we expected that he said on fox business network am going to give the same message to the naacp that give across the country which is that obamacare is killing jobs two african american members of the house of representatives found themselves split after romney appearance he gets credit for attendance rep cedric richmond louisiana democrat said on cnn the situation room but perfect attendance doesn qualify you to be class president thought it was good gesture to go but thought his content was lacking rep tim scott republican from south carolina also said on the situation room that he expects romney to get about 10 of the black vote come november suggesting the gop candidate focus should be on unemployment and home foreclosures african american unemployment since 2008 is up 40 scott said home closures 25 so what we have is the same message that works for the rest of america works for the black community too romney draws boos from naacp support from conservatives cnn dan lothian shawna shepherd shannon travis and ed payne and contributed to this report \n",

has begun tour across the south showing off its corpse rick dyer who describes himself as best bigfoot tracker in the world claims to have shot the beast near san antonio in texas in september 2012 despite releasing various photographs supposedly showing the dead bigfoot there is great deal of skepticism over their authenticity mr dyer who is used car salesman was previously involved in bigfoot hoax in 2008 when corpse he put on public display turned out to be rubber suit scroll down for video believe it or not here lies bigfoot who was killed by used car salesman rick dyer in 2012 he is now on tour with the corpse dyer is the same person who staged bigfoot hoax in 2008 but this time he swears he is not lying on display rick dyer released this new image supposedly showing the bigfoot he killed lying dead on the floor of his tent he is now taking the corpse on cross country tour is he for real rick dyer calls himself master tracker but also knows there are people out there who are going to dispute his claim and he doesn care raking it in dyer is on nationwide tour showing off his supposed bigfoot corpse for 20 per person the display is now in houston and drew about 800 people to trader village in northwest harris county on sunday we got here day early and we just wanted to show as many people as possible said mr dyer bigfoot is not the tooth fairy bigfoot is real people of all ages shelled out money to enter his trailer to look into the 9 foot case that holds the specimen dyer calls hank the body of the creature can be viewed under glass coffin adorned with camouflaged baseball hats not convinced said mario lopez after taking look with his wife julia and their three children believe the roger patterson footage is authentic because you can see the muscles and everything on there but this one was kind of different but he did mention that after the autopsy the body kind of changes he said to the houston chronicle roger patterson is the man who filmed one of the most famous sightings back in 1967 patterson died in 1972 and the man who wore the gorilla suit in the film even admitted it was hoax wendy hernandez was so convinced that she bought shirt and had dyer sign it it amazing when you go inside you feel different she said had never seen anything like this before only on the discovery channel body of the beast rick dyer claims that this is photo of legendary creature bigfoot which he shot near san antonio 18 months ago mr dyer claims that he lured the 800 pound beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from walmart to tree in san antonio texas in september 2012 he initially released grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature face but has now released second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill 36 year old dyer said he didn regret his 2008 hoax as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full time bigfoot operations ever since he claims that without the previous publicity stunt he would never have been able to really capture bigfoot have 13 months with it dyer said last month then it will probably go into museum as the first bigfoot ever killed on the bigfoot trail rick dyer says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at walmart to tree while the creature was eating mr dyer allegedly shot it speaking of the moment he killed the beast he said nailed pork ribs from the walmart down the street to the side of the tree and lo and behold he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree mr dyer claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal before going to get his gun and with tears in my eyes shot it dead the excitement surrounding mr dyer claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in bigfoot hoax back in 2008 back then as now he claimed he had the body of bigfoot but the national geographic reported that once the frozen body began to thaw the body turned out to be nothing more than rubber ape suit this time mr dyer is adamant that his bigfoot is for real he said from dna tests to 3d optical scans to body scans it is the real deal it bigfoot and bigfoot here and shot it and now proving it to the world video by rick dyer committed hunter mr dyer is self proclaimed real bigfoot tracker although he is used car salesman in his spare time there was hoax in 2008 he said it didn’t start out as hoax and that’s what people don’t understand this is about redeeming myself don’t want to go down as hoaxer want to go down as the best bigfoot tracker in the world however mr dyer has yet to produce the results of the dna tests and optical scans bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the world but physical evidence such as partial or complete body of the creature has so far proven elusive his tour has so far been traveling across texas and will visit louisiana georgia and florida over the coming months admission costs 20 fuzzy face what appears to be large humanoid creature scowls at the camera in this grainy still from video footage mr dyer claims it is none other than bigfoot

real women who aren’t afraid to flaunt their flabby bits who can but applaud we are encouraged to believe the recent spate of advertisements from the likes of and dove cosmetics in which stick thin taut and toned models have been rejected in favour of what are euphemistically known as ‘big’ girls marks spencer use models to promote the retailer sexy shapewear range dr ellie cannon said some could be overweight while one was obese taking the test from left julia angela sarah melissa tracey and monica gave their verdicts on the underwear after the advert stirred up controversy the message is loud and clear forget twiggy and myleene klass the former faces of all things fashionable and instead embrace the woman you truly are complete with your voluptuous curves and pudgy love handles at face value it all sounds very encouraging very to coin current buzz word but hold on minute aren’t we rather ignoring the elephant in the room here pardon the pun fat truth be told is neither feminist nor cosmetic issue it is quite simply health issue and we shouldn’t allow ourselves to be steered into losing sight of that fact it may appear laudable in our current politically correct climate to claim that criticising the larger lady is just as despicable as taunting the disabled or discriminating against someone because of their age or origin but frankly it’s utterly wrong the fact is it is absolutely outrageous that in an effort to illustrate the diversity of women obesity has taken its place alongside ageing and differing skin colours yes these adverts have captured the notion of individuality beautifully by using women in their 50s but including overweight and therefore unhealthy women in the mix is downright misguided at best too good to be true the mail asked real women julia angela and melissa to put slimming clothes to the test overweight the models said to represent ordinary women could be overweight according to the dr for example in the advert for its shapewear control underwear which uses women from sizes eight to 16 would say that lovely as they all look at least two if not three are overweight while the biggest girl is obese yet when women took to twitter to voice their response to the adverts the majority complained the models were ‘too perfect with too few wobbly bits ’ all too often celebrities such as the model sophie dahl or nigella lawson are touted as real women with real bodies but both have trimmed their figures in sophie’s case by several stone and say they are much happier having shed the flab statistics show that the prevalence of obesity in the uk has tripled in the past 25 years but the fact it is now so common does not make it satisfactory or healthy it may seem unfair to criticise what is essentially very common problem but day to day as gp deal with the medical consequences of patients who are overweight obesity makes woman four times as likely to suffer with high blood pressure and three times as likely to suffer heart attack according to the department of health obesity costs the nhs staggering £5 1billion year am really concerned by this trend of supposedly empowering women by what has become known as the ‘body acceptance movement’ which embraces the notion that fat is fine while fat may be fine cosmetically it is not fine for your health body shape has been hijacked solely as fashion issue and as ammunition in the war of cool versus uncool thus it is perceived as cruel and ‘size to attack those who are fat strongly condemn bullying whether it be for personal appearance or any other reason but what worries me is that the real health risks of obesity are being glossed over in an effort not to offend anyone yet at the same time we are running around in circles trying to find the obesity solution in the food and fitness industries as well as the pharmaceutical and medical fields while we readily criticise and ban smoking junk food is still an acceptable vice and overeating is rapidly becoming the biggest eating disorder in the country indeed compulsive overeating has recently been recognised in medical literature as disorder in its own right there is an understandable backlash against the anorexic models the fashion industry has promoted for the past three decades the continuing use of ill looking skeletal models is shameful and rightly condemned we know from studies of anorexics that when they idolise and obsess over images of these very thin women it exacerbates their illness and perpetuates their self loathing and body dysmorphia isn’t it just as irresponsible to promote the notion that being overweight is perfectly normal the all party parliamentary group on body image was established in 2011 to challenge the growing trend in negative body image and they work with those such as the advertising industry to address this issue they have for example stopped the use of size zero models while this is admirable we need to ensure that by trying to sort out one problem we don’t exacerbate another given that third of british women are overweight it will do our teenage daughters no favours to normalise obesity companies such as have firm place in the hearts of the public and in that respect they often mould opinions and shape our aspirations it is shame they wasted great opportunity to promote what is healthy \n",

            "Review: for mark cooper the best phone call of saturday night was one he made to his dad terry not because he could tell him how his swindon team had ended bristol city’s unbeaten record but because he could make it at all mark had spent the last international break at the hospital bedside in tenerife where terry england’s swashbuckling left back in the 1970 world cup was in intensive care following life or death bowel cancer operation it was personal trauma he had done his best to keep to himself while handling the problems of helping the football league’s youngest team to recover from 5 0 fa cup hammering at cheltenham mark cooper saw his swindon side beat bristol city to end their unbeaten run in league one michael smith scored the only goal of the game in the 78th minute at the county ground cooper had been in tenerife with his father but on saturday night the 45 year old could enjoy calling to share the details of successful day and how his side with an average age of 21 and three quarters had moved into league one’s automatic promotion places they had some help when city captain wade elliott got sent off after barely three minutes but then passed the ball relentlessly to exploit their extra man before striker michael smith right finally picked his way through packed defence to get the winner 12 minutes from time ‘i couldn’t wait to speak to dad admitted mark ‘he’s back home and just about on level now where he can focus and talk he was in intensive care for 10 days and has had that many drugs ‘it was fortunate that when he was at his most critical it was the international break we had three players called up then so we had the weekend off and managed to get out there for four days ‘the doctors said it was touch and go had to get there he was in intensive care the whole time it wasn’t nice ‘thankfully they say the operations have been successful and he’s clear now and will keep recovering he loves bristol city and has such fond memories of his time there as do because that’s where started as player but for once he’s probably happy they’ve been beaten ’ when the fixtures came out this was the first his father had booked flights for from his canary island home where he was based as southampton’s chief european scout mark’s own playing career was far less stellar than his old man who was stalwart in don revie’s all conquering leeds united teams of the 1960s but after scrapping through non league jobs at tamworth kettering darlington and telford he’s fallen on his feet cooper dad terry was in intensive care after make or break bowel cancer operation swindon is club where chairman lee power himself an ex player is building strategy based on youth and belief in passing football the budget is measly £1 5million year fraction of that spent by league one leaders city but the faith in youth is both developing their own kids and making the club favoured destination for premier league sides to send their young talent on loan last season some of tottenham’s best youngsters including ryan mason progressed at the county ground this time southampton’s impressive england defender jack stephens just 20 looked the pick of the potential terry cooper right in action for england against brazil jairzinho during the 1970 world cup in mexico ‘the chairman has been brilliant he’s an ex player so he understands cooper said ‘he put this club on sound financial footing and insisted that we try and play real good football he wants to do that so we can bring young players through ’ cooper knows it will take miracle to keep his young side in the promotion hunt it’s long season and trip to peterborough next week will be more immediate challenge but on saturday night he could enjoy small success and more important so could his dad performance of the weekend bradford have taken time to adjust to league one since promotion through the play offs in 2013 but clicked to end preston’s unbeaten run at deepdale which went back to december they dominated after leading through rory first half header and even when joe garner scrambled an equaliser five minutes from time it took just 60 seconds for mark yeates to curl in 20 yard winner bradford ended preston unbeaten run at deepdale which had stretched back to december with 2 1 win what caught my eye more like what my eye couldn’t see more than 117 000 people watched the 19 games in league one and two on saturday yet the bbc don’t think it’s worth running the football league show on international weekends derek asamoah had not played english football since walking out of shrewsbury in 2007 that’s until carlisle gave him shot and the 33 year old got his fourth goal in five in 1 0 win over accrington derek asamoah celebrates after scoring the winner for carlisle

back online experts have warned high water is preventing inspectors from quickly assessing damage meaning the nation largest city could face an extended shutdown of the system that 5million people count on each day joseph lhota chairman of the state agency that runs the subway said service might have to resume piecemeal and experts said the cost of repairs could be staggering scroll down for video 100 year storm debris and flood waters filled the south ferry subway station as study predicted that new york transport infrastructure would not be online for three weeks after 100 year storm historic shut down as flood waters inundated many stations including 86th street mayor michael bloomberg announced that subway service would be shut down until saturday or sunday only the second time it has ever closed mayor michael bloomberg announced yesterday that the subway would be shut down until saturday or sunday total closure of six to seven days but group of columbia university researchers analysing the effects of smaller hurricane or tropical storm suggest that it would shut down the subways for 21 days and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars the report by klaus jacob geophysicist who specializes in disaster management examined the effects on the city’s transportation infrastructure of 100 year storm dr jacob and his researchers used as model storm less powerful than superstorm such as sandy one that has only one per cent chance of happening in any given year subway submerged man takes photograph of the flooded whitehall street station as dozens were damaged by the storm surge that rose water levels by 13 feet then report estimated that hurricane hitting nearby could result in billion gallons of water flooding each of the subway’s 14 tunnels that run under the east river there has always been flooding in the tunnels which collect storm water constantly but the metropolitan transportation authority said sandy was the worst disaster in the subway’s 108 year history trains stopped running at 7pm on sunday as the mta preemptively closed down service for only the second time in its history the closure was an effort to secure the subway system against the impending storm but massive damage came anyway worst disaster after several stations were damaged including 86th street station the mta said the sandy superstorm was the worst disaster in the subway 108 year history limited bus service began again yesterday and some bridges reopened at midday but transit officials said they could not predict when the subway would run again one tunnel the south ferry station at manhattan southern end was flooded entirely from track to the ceiling more than 468 stations and 600 miles of track now have to be carefully examined each tunnel was expected to take at least five days to pump dry after the tidal surge of almost 14 feet the u s army corps of engineers’ rock island district deployed team of engineers yesterday to support new york colleagues in the preemptive effort trains stopped running on sunday night in an effort to secure the subway system including emergency dam erected at irt subway lenox terminal the team were specially trained in new orleans where they dealt with the aftermath of hurricane katrina and are preparing their large stock of pumps water in the two vehicle tunnels receded slightly as the tide fell tuesday morning but the massive pumps that will eventually empty the tubes were unable to immediately make headway because the places where they normally send water the river and sewer system remained so high the outflow pipes in the pumping system were still submerged our pumps are working it just that the water has no place to go mta spokeswoman judy glave said we pump it out and it just comes back in once the water is removed engineers must then examine the equipment to see how much corrosion damage was wrought by the salt water that soaked the switches signals electrical wires and stations each has to be out of the water before it is touched and and any damage will have to be fixed before the system can be restored pump flood waters each tunnel is expected to take at leave five days to pump dry keeping stations closed until saturday or sunday in the tunnels under the east river all the signal and control systems are underwater and it is salt water dr jacob told the wall street journal it not just that it doesn work right now it all has to be cleaned dried reassembled and tested and we are not sure what the long term corrosion effect might be think we have come to the end of studies what we need now is action governor andrew cuomo agreed adding we have to start thinking about how we redesign the system so this doesn happen again don think anyone can sit back anymore and say shocked at this weather pattern there is no weather pattern that can shock me anymore school was canceled for third straight day wednesday in the city where many students rely on buses and subways to reach classrooms mayor bloomberg has said that sunday’s marathon will still take place but even if runners are able to fly in it will be difficult to get everyone to the starting line without subway dr jacob’s 21 day estimate covers the time it is predicted to take city workers to bring the subway system back to 90 per cent function \n",

at worcester magistrates court district judge nigel cadbury said there was no point sending edwards to prison immediately because of her vulnerable state he said you have got previous convictions for dishonesty so you can clearly be described as dishonest the facts of this case are particularly harrowing you were supposed to care for an 85 year old woman who is unable to care for herself it took surveillance cameras to catch you at it you admitted the offence but you still did not plead guilty until the day of the trial anybody reading about this case will think is is abhorrent what you have done has easily crossed the custody threshold have no idea why previous magistrates suggested otherwise they just have been reading the wrong guidelines scroll down for video caught in the act edwards was seen on camera stealing from dementia sufferer irene goody 85 after mrs goody family became concerned that money was going missing and set up cctv camera in her flat anybody reading about this must know that stealing from an 85 year old woman could results them going to prison it must be deterrent but there is no point sending someone with your emotional and physical issues to prison into

that money for meal out had gone missing from her purse she asked he husband to instal some cameras and they were put in in august when he mother was asleep so as not to notify her to their presence when the defendant was arrested she admitted to taking the money but claimed that she had been given permission to take it by mr edwards believe that is the defence she planned on using in court she did not change her guilty plea until the very last minute the afternoon of the trial in fact the surveillance footage shows her taking the money at one point the defendant even called mrs helps and claimed the money she was owed for caring duties had also gone missing this is aggravated by the fact that the theft was from dwelling and is in particularly distressing circumstances joanne outhwaite

did and the distress she caused she was on the verge of losing her home and had suffered major illness that stopped her working she used the money to pay for living costs position of trust edwards had

last yea at an earlier hearing on january 19 after the case mr helps company director said it bit disappointing really it doesn send out the strongest message she was in position of trust and she severely breached that trust we would have liked to have seen stronger sentence but more than anything we wanted people to know what she had done hopefully that way it won happen to other people in future and make people think twice about committing similar crimes edwards was also ordered to pay £120 compensation an £85 victim surcharge and £620 in costs as well as undergo 12 month community

            "Review: this is the house my mom asks turning around yes says our guide this is where your grandmother was born my mother and have traveled more than 000 miles to explore candia tiny village outside torino italy founded in the fifth century we re here to learn more about our heritage and get sense of where her family is from we re not the first ones to visit for that reason even though candia has population of just 200 our guide says plenty of other travelers have come searching for records data photos and that intangible sense of history you can get without visiting place yourself interest in genealogy appears to be at an all time high with recent harris interactive survey indicating that four in five americans wish to learn more about their family history shows like cnn upcoming roots our journeys home along with series who do you think you are and finding your roots are gaining in popularity people see these programs and they want that experience for themselves says michelle ercanbrack family historian at ancestry com as result she says more travelers are looking to incorporate family history research into trip or even plan standalone journey for the sole purpose of discovering their roots want to embark on your own family tree trip here are some tips and techniques to help smooth the process get your history organized before you leave if you re spending the time and money to get to far flung destination you don want to spend your visit stuck in library or office it more rewarding to get your history organized before you leave start with what you know and build your tree online says ercanbrack sites like ancestry com org and genealogy com can get you on the right track while genealogy research site com has comprehensive collection of useful links for example ancestry com has 14 billion searchable indexed records everything from passenger records to census data and more remember online records can build the branches but there will be holes things you can find because of records loss or privacy details ercanbrack adds beyond just building out family tree skeleton online it also wise to create historical timeline before your trip snapshot of the family movements will help you see holes easier for example start with one family member say grandparent and create timeline of where and when they were born where they lived went to school were married and so forth writing things down in narrative fashion can help you pinpoint gaps like when child might have been born or family member emigrated let them know you re coming regardless if where in the world family history travel takes you it helps to get in touch with few locals before you arrive people worth contacting include librarians city clerks museum officers and clergy giving information in advance helps researcher flag potential documents and can maximize time on the ground while visiting prior to our italy trip my mother and got in touch with the innkeeper at the one hotel in the village to inquire about an italian speaking guide to help us our host went above and beyond as it turns out his family had lived in the village for generations and knew all the people we needed to speak to because we sent information requests with family names and dates in advance by the time we arrived he had already laid the groundwork and we had appointments with the priest and the city clerk office that allowed us to spend good chunk of our time wandering the streets taking in the ambiance and imagining how my great grandmother family lived on site research tombstones and immigration offices sure you may have to spend time browsing through old boxes and files searching for documents but there are countless of other places to find data while visiting location visiting the place is where you do the finishing touches says ercanbrack cemeteries local cemeteries often provide location based details you won find in other files such as place of death they can also turn up details on previously unknown family members or even children that died as infants and were never recorded ercanbrack offers great tip for getting details off worn headstone shine flashlight directly above the headstone to cast shadow on engravings you can then take picture of the shadow it far more effective than using the paper rubbing with charcoal technique you see so often in the movies that can actually permanently damage the headstone immigration offices passport applications and naturalization records can be information as they often include detailed information on family records places of residence and work military va offices military pension records also are crammed with data including dates and location of service awards and recognition and time spent overseas note that these might be harder to access and there are privacy issues concerning release of some statistics but worth investigating by the end of our journey we discovered new details previously blank on the family tree more importantly we felt connected to place that was previously just spot on the map as alex haley author of roots so eloquently put it in all of us there is hunger marrow deep to know our heritage to know who we are and where we have come from without this enriching knowledge there is hollow yearning \n",
